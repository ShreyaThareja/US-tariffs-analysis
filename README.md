# US-tariffs-analysis
This project analyzes the impact of U.S. tariffs on imports, exports, and consumer prices using real-world trade and inflation data. It combines exploratory data analysis, causal inference, and forecasting models, and presents key insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.


# U.S. Tariffs Data Analytics Project ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the economic impact of U.S. tariff policies on trade, consumer prices, and financial markets.  
It combines exploratory data analysis, causal inference, and forecasting models, and presents key insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - U.S. Tariffs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/texasdowney/2018-us-tariffs)  
- Contains tariff rates, trade volumes, and product-level data across multiple years.  
- Supplementary datasets: U.S. inflation (CPI), stock market indices, and import/export statistics.  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub (for version control and collaboration)  

## ðŸ“Š Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning and combining multiple datasets.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Trends in tariffs, imports, exports, prices.  
3. **Causal Analysis** â€“ Using difference-in-differences to estimate impact of tariffs.  
4. **Forecasting Models** â€“ Time-series analysis to predict future trade flows.  
5. **Dashboard** â€“ Interactive Power BI dashboard to present findings.  

## ðŸš€ Key Insights
- Tariff increases were associated with reduced imports in affected categories.  
- Some tariffs contributed to higher consumer prices, suggesting partial pass-through.  
- Forecast models show potential risk of inflationary pressure under continued tariff policies.
